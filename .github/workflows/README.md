### 🌳 Branch Flow

```
Dev ─────► feature ─────► Stage ─────► release/yyyymmdd-count ─────► Main (PROD)
                                                                        ▲
                                                                        │
                                                                     hotfix
```

**Production deployments** use date-based release branches (`release/yyyymmdd-count`) and require manual approval before deploying to production.

## 🚀 Key Features & Optimizations

### 🔒 **1. Security Permissions** (Phase 1)

**Principle of least privilege** applied to all workflows:

- Jobs only have necessary permissions
- `contents: read` for most jobs
- `pull-requests: write` only where needed (for PR comments)

### ⚡ **2. Advanced Caching** (Phase 2 & 5)

**Multiple cache layers for maximum performance**:

- ✅ **Actions Cache v4** - Latest with improved compression
- ✅ **Node modules** - Cached via `setup-node`
- ✅ **Next.js build** - `.next/cache` preserved between runs
- ✅ **ESLint cache** - `.eslintcache` for 30-50% faster linting

**Expected cache hit rate**: ~70-80%

### 🎯 **3. Intelligent Path Filtering** (Phase 3)

**Saves 60-70% of CI runs** by skipping workflows on non-code changes:

**Workflows RUN on**:

- ✅ Source code files (`**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`)
- ✅ Dependencies (`package.json`, `yarn.lock`)
- ✅ Config files (`next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.)
- ✅ All source directories (`components/`, `pages/`, `app/`, etc.)

**Workflows SKIP on**:

- ⏭️ Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/**`, `*.md`)
- ⏭️ Workflow changes (`.github/workflows/**`)
- ⏭️ License files (`LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- ⏭️ Git config (`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`)

### 💡 **4. Draft PR Skip** (Phase 4)

**Saves 66% of resources during development**:

- ⏭️ All jobs skip when PR is in draft mode
- ✅ CI runs only when marked "Ready for Review"
- 🎯 Developers can iterate freely without wasting CI minutes

### 📦 **5. No Build Artifacts in CI** (Intentional)

**Why PR builds don't save artifacts:**

- ❌ **PR builds are throwaway** - Never deployed to any environment
- ❌ **Wasteful storage** - Every PR creates artifacts that are never used
- ❌ **Logs are sufficient** - Error messages in logs provide enough debug info
- ✅ **Artifacts in CD only** - Deployment builds save artifacts for rollback/audit

**Where artifacts ARE saved:**

- ✅ CD workflows (`deploy-dev.yml`, `deploy-stage.yml`)
- ✅ Used for deployment verification and rollback
- ✅ Stored in Azure Container Registry as Docker images

### 📊 **6. Professional Summaries** (Phase 7)

**Enhanced developer experience**:

**GitHub Actions Summary Page**:

- Overview of all checks at a glance
- No need to dig through logs
- Links to detailed results

**Enhanced PR Comments** (on failure):

- Clear status indicators
- Fix commands included
- Helpful debugging tips
- Direct links to workflow runs

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. CI Workflows Setup (PR Validation & Commit Validation)

The CI workflows are ready to use as-is. No additional configuration required.

### 2. CD Workflows Setup (Deployment)

**Required setup for deployment workflows:**

1. **Create GitHub Environments**:
   - Go to Settings → Environments
   - Create `dev` and `stage` environments
   - Configure protection rules (optional for dev, recommended for stage)

2. **Add Secrets to Each Environment**:
   - Registry secrets (ACR credentials) - 3 secrets
   - SSH secrets (server access) - 4 secrets
   - Application secrets (environment variables) - 33 secrets
   - See detailed list: [DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md)

3. **Verify Infrastructure**:
   - Azure Container Registry is accessible
   - VMs are accessible via SSH (or password authentication)
   - Docker is installed on target servers

**📚 Deployment Documentation:**

- 🚀 **Quick Start**: [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) - Fast setup guide with checklists
- 📖 **Full Setup Guide**: [DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md) - Comprehensive deployment setup
- 🔧 **Troubleshooting**: [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common issues and solutions

**Note on SSH Authentication:**

- Workflows support both SSH key-based and password authentication
- SSH keys are recommended for better security
- Password authentication is simpler for initial setup
- Consult your DevOps team for existing credentials

### 3. Configure Branch Protection Rules

**Recommended settings**:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule**
2. **Branch name pattern**: `main` or `develop`
3. **Require status checks to pass**:
   - ✅ `Code Quality & Build Check`
   - ✅ `Security Scan`
   - ✅ `Performance Check`
   - ✅ `Validate Commit Messages` (for develop branch)
4. **Require branches to be up to date**: ✅ Enable
5. **Required approvals**: 1-2 reviewers
6. **Restrict pushes**: ✅ Enable

### 4. Secrets Configuration

**CI Workflows** (PR & Commit Validation):

- ✅ No secrets required - works out of the box

**CD Workflows** (Deployments):

- ⚠️ Requires environment-specific secrets
- See [DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md) for complete list
- Secrets are configured per GitHub Environment (dev, stage)

**Optional Secrets**:

- `YARN_TOKEN` - For publishing packages
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - For SonarQube integration

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal PR Workflow

```
Developer creates PR → Path filter checks files
Code change detected → All jobs run
ESLint, Prettier, Build → All pass
PR is approved → Ready to merge ✅
```

### Example 2: Draft PR Workflow

```
Developer creates Draft PR → All jobs SKIP ⏭️
Makes 5 commits → All jobs SKIP ⏭️
Marks "Ready for Review" → All jobs RUN ✅
CI validates code → Results shown
```

### Example 3: Documentation Update

```
Developer updates README.md → Path filter checks
Only docs changed → All jobs SKIP ⏭️
PR approved directly → Merge immediately ✅
```

### Example 4: Build Failure Investigation

```
Build fails in CI → Check workflow run
Read build logs → Find error message
Fix the issue → Push changes
Build succeeds ✅
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Custom Validation Steps

Edit workflow files to add custom checks:

```yaml
- name: Custom Security Check
  run: |
    yarn audit:custom
    yarn scan:dependencies
```

### Modifying Path Filters

Edit the `paths` section to customize triggers:

```yaml
paths:
  - 'src/**' # Your source directory
  - 'config/**' # Your config directory
  - '**/*.ts' # TypeScript files (if you add TS later)
```

### Adjusting Cache Keys

Customize cache invalidation:

```yaml
key: ${{ runner.os }}-custom-${{ hashFiles('**/package.json') }}
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Workflow skipped unexpectedly"

**Cause**: Path filter excluded your files  
**Solution**: Check `paths` in workflow trigger and ensure your files are included

#### 2. "Cache not being used"

**Cause**: Cache key changed (dependencies or config updated)  
**Solution**: This is normal! First run after changes will rebuild cache

#### 3. "ESLint cache not working"

**Cause**: `.eslintcache` might be committed to git  
**Solution**: Verify `.eslintcache` is in `.gitignore` (already added)

#### 4. "Draft PR still running CI"

**Cause**: PR was converted from ready to draft after CI started  
**Solution**: Cancel running workflow and re-convert to draft

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add repository secret:
   - Name: `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG`
   - Value: `true`

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### View Workflow Statistics

1. **Actions tab** → **Workflows**
2. Select workflow → View runs
3. Check:
   - Success/failure rate
   - Average execution time
   - Cache hit rates

### Download Workflow Reports

GitHub provides insights on:

- Billable minutes used
- Workflow run durations
- Job completion rates

---

## 🔄 Integration with Azure Pipelines

**Current Strategy**: Dual CI/CD during migration

- **GitHub Actions**: PR validation & code quality (this setup)
- **Azure Pipelines**: Production builds & deployments

**Future State**: GitHub Actions only (migration in progress)

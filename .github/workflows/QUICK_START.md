## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Get Information from Coworkers ✍️

Before you can deploy, you need these details:

- [ ] **Azure Container Registry URL** (e.g., `shiplink.azurecr.io`)
- [ ] **Registry Username** (usually same as registry name)
- [ ] **Registry Password** (from Azure Portal → Container Registries → Access Keys)
- [ ] **DEV Server SSH Host** (hostname or IP)
- [ ] **DEV Server SSH Username** (e.g., `azureuser`)
- [ ] **DEV Server SSH Private Key** (full key with headers)
- [ ] **STAGE Server SSH Host** (hostname or IP)
- [ ] **STAGE Server SSH Username**
- [ ] **STAGE Server SSH Private Key**
- [ ] **STAGE Environment Secrets** (like dev secrets but stage-specific)

---

### Step 2: Create GitHub Environments 🌍

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Click **Environments** (left sidebar)
4. Create two environments:
   - Name: `dev` (click "New environment")
   - Name: `stage` (click "New environment")

---

### Step 3: Add Secrets to DEV Environment 🔐

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environments** → **dev**
2. Scroll to **Environment secrets**
3. Add these secrets one by one (click "Add secret"):

#### Registry Secrets (3 secrets)

```
ACR_REGISTRY_URL     = (get from coworkers)
ACR_USERNAME         = (get from coworkers)
ACR_PASSWORD         = (get from coworkers)
```

#### SSH Secrets (5 secrets)

```
SSH_HOST             = (get from coworkers)
SSH_USERNAME         = (get from coworkers)
SSH_PORT             = 22
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY      = (full key including -----BEGIN----- and -----END-----) [for key auth]
SSH_PASSWORD         = (server password) [for password auth - alternative to key]
```

**Note:** Use either `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (recommended) OR `SSH_PASSWORD` - not both.

#### Application Secrets (38 secrets)

**⚠️ SECURITY NOTE**: Actual secret values should be obtained from your team lead, DevOps team, or secure password manager.

**To get the secret values:**

1. Contact your DevOps team or team lead
2. Check your team's secure password manager (e.g., 1Password, LastPass, Azure Key Vault)
3. Refer to environment-specific documentation
4. See [DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md) for the complete list of 38 required secrets with descriptions

**Required secrets include:**

- API URLs and endpoints (10 secrets)
- Authentication & authorization (7 secrets)
- Third-party integrations (Seametrix, reCAPTCHA, New Relic) (17 secrets)
- Feature flags and configuration (4 secrets)

---

### Step 4: Add Secrets to STAGE Environment 🔐

Repeat Step 3 but:

- Go to **Environments** → **stage**
- Use same registry secrets (ACR is usually shared)
- Use different SSH credentials (stage server) - 5 SSH secrets
- Use stage-specific application URLs and secrets (get from coworkers)
- Change `APP_ENV=stage`

---

### Step 5: Test Deployment 🧪

#### Method 1: Manual Test (Recommended First)

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Click **Deploy to Development** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button (right side)
4. Select branch: `develop`
5. Add reason: "First deployment test"
6. Click **Run workflow** button
7. Watch the deployment happen! 🎉

#### Method 2: Automatic Test (After Manual Test Works)

1. Create a small change in your code
2. Create a PR targeting `develop` branch
3. Get PR approved
4. Merge the PR
5. Deployment automatically starts!

## 🎯 How to Monitor Deployment

### In GitHub Actions

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the running workflow
3. You'll see two jobs:
   - **Build & Push Docker Image** (5-8 min)
   - **Deploy to Dev Server** (2-3 min)
4. Click on each job to see detailed logs

### Success Indicators

✅ Green checkmarks on both jobs  
✅ Summary page shows deployment details  
✅ No error messages in logs  
✅ Website is accessible and working

### Failure Indicators

❌ Red X on one or both jobs  
❌ Error messages in logs  
❌ Website shows 502/503 errors  
🔄 Automatic rollback may have occurred

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot login to registry"

**Fix**: Check your ACR secrets (ACR_USERNAME, ACR_PASSWORD, ACR_REGISTRY_URL)

### Error: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**Fix**: Check SSH authentication - either SSH_PRIVATE_KEY includes full key with headers/footers OR SSH_PASSWORD is set correctly

### Error: "Container exited immediately"

**Fix**: Check application secrets - one or more might be missing or wrong

### Deployment Stuck?

**Fix**: Wait for 10-minute timeout, then check server directly via SSH

**For all other issues**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

---

## 🔄 How to Rollback

### If Automatic Rollback Didn't Work

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Find a previous successful deployment
3. Note the image tag (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`)
4. Click **Re-run all jobs**
5. Or SSH into server and manually start old container

**Detailed instructions**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#manual-rollback)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After your first successful deployment:

- [ ] Deployment completed in ~10 minutes
- [ ] Website is accessible at dev URL
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] API calls are working
- [ ] Login functionality works
- [ ] No 502/503 errors
- [ ] Deployment summary shows in GitHub
- [ ] You can see container running on server (via SSH)

---

## 🏗️ Understanding the Architecture

We use a **reusable workflow pattern** to avoid code duplication:

```
deploy-dev.yml      → Calls deploy-reusable.yml with environment=dev
deploy-stage.yml    → Calls deploy-reusable.yml with environment=stage
deploy-reusable.yml → Contains all the actual deployment logic
```

**Why this matters:**

- ✅ When you need to modify deployment logic, you only update `deploy-reusable.yml`
- ✅ Dev, stage, and production use exactly the same deployment core logic
- ✅ Production adds extra safety features: approval gates, health checks, branch validation

**You don't need to touch `deploy-reusable.yml`** - it's already fully configured. You only interact with environment-specific workflows for triggers.

## 🏭 Production Deployment Quick Reference

### Branch Flow

```
Dev ─────► feature ─────► Stage ─────► release/yyyymmdd-count ─────► Main (PROD)
                                                                        ▲
                                                                        │
                                                                     hotfix
```

### Production Setup (One-Time)

1. **Create `prod` environment** in GitHub (Settings → Environments)
2. **Add production secrets** (same 45 secrets as dev/stage, but PROD values)
3. **Configure approvers** (1-2 team members who can approve deployments)
4. **Set branch protection** on `main` (only `release/*` and `hotfix/*` allowed)

### Production Deployment Process

**Step 1: Create Release Branch**

```bash
# Today's date: October 10, 2025
# First release of the day: -1

git checkout stage
git pull origin stage
git checkout -b release/20251010-1
git push origin release/20251010-1
```

**Step 2: Create PR to main**

- From: `release/20251010-1`
- To: `main`
- Use PR template from [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md)

**Step 3: Get PR Approved & Merge**

- Requires code review approval
- Merge the PR (triggers deployment workflow)

**Step 4: Approve Deployment**

1. Go to **Issues** tab
2. Find the approval issue (labeled `deploy-approval`)
3. Review deployment details (release version, image tag, etc.)
4. Add the label `deploy-approved` to the issue
5. Approval workflow will automatically trigger

**Step 5: Monitor Deployment**

Watch for:

```
# Initial Workflow (deploy-prod.yml)
✅ Branch validation passed
✅ Docker image built
✅ Approval issue created
⏸️  Waiting for approval label...

# After Adding deploy-approved Label (approve-deploy-prod.yml)
✅ Approval detected
✅ Container deployed
⏳ Running health checks...
✅ Health check: Home Page - PASS
✅ Health check: API Health - PASS
✅ Health check: Auth Service - PASS
✅ Health check: Vessels API - PASS
🎉 Production deployment successful!
```

### Production Deployment Timeline

```
0:00  - PR merged to main
0:01  - Workflow triggered
0:02  - Source branch validated
0:05  - Docker build starts
5:00  - Image pushed to registry
6:00  - Approval issue created
⏸️    - WAITING FOR deploy-approved LABEL
      (approver reviews and adds label)
      - Approval workflow triggers automatically
+0:00 - Container deployment starts
+3:00 - Container deployed
+3:30 - Wait 60 seconds for stabilization
+4:30 - Running health checks
+6:00 - ✅ Deployment complete!
```

**Total time: ~6-8 minutes** (from build) + **approval time** (manual review)

### Health Checks

Production deployments include automated health checks:

- **Home Page** (/) - 200 OK
- **API Health** (/api/health) - 200 OK
- **Auth Service** - 200 or 401 expected
- **Protected API** (/v1/charterer/vessels) - 401 (means healthy)

If ANY check fails → **Automatic rollback** to previous version

### Release Branch Naming

- Format: `release/yyyymmdd-count`
- `yyyymmdd`: Today's date (YYYYMMDD)
- `count`: Number of releases today (start with 1)

**Examples:**

```bash
release/20251010-1  # First release on Oct 10, 2025
release/20251010-2  # Second release same day
release/20251125-1  # First release on Nov 25, 2025
```

### Hotfix (Emergency Only)

For critical production fixes:

```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# Make minimal fix, test thoroughly

# Create PR: hotfix/* → main
# Get approved and merge
# Approve deployment in GitHub Actions

# Backport to other branches
git checkout dev
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit>

git checkout stage
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit>
```

### Production Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

- Deploy during off-peak hours
- Monitor health checks closely
- Have rollback plan ready
- Test thoroughly on stage first
- Use milestones to track releases

❌ **DON'T:**

- Deploy on Fridays (unless critical)
- Skip approval step
- Deploy without testing
- Ignore health check failures

**For Complete Guide**: See [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md)

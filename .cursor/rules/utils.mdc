# Utilities (`utils/`)

This rule defines the purpose and conventions for the `utils/` directory.

## Purpose

- The `utils/` directory is intended for pure, reusable helper functions that are framework-agnostic and can be used across different parts of the application.
- These functions should be small, focused, and perform a single task (e.g., data formatting, validation helpers, string manipulation).

## Conventions

- **Organization**: Group related utility functions into logical files (e.g., `dateUtils.js`, `stringUtils.js`, `validationUtils.js`).
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for files and functions (camelCase for functions).
- **Purity**: Functions in `utils/` should ideally be pure, meaning they produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Dependencies**: Avoid dependencies on specific components, services, or store logic within `utils/` functions. If a function requires complex application state or logic, it might belong elsewhere.

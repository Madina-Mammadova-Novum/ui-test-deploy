# State Management with Redux Toolkit

This rule outlines the guidelines for using Redux Toolkit for state management in the ShipLink platform, complementing the information in [docs/technical/stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/stack.md).

## Store Structure (`store/`)

- **Configuration**: The main store configuration is typically found in `store/store.js`, including middleware (like Thunk for async actions) and integration with tools like Redux Persist.
- **Reducers/Slices**: Business logic for state updates resides in slices, likely located within `store/reducers/` or `store/entities/`. Slices should follow standard Redux Toolkit patterns (`createSlice`).
- **Selectors**: Memoized selectors, created using `createSelector` (from Reselect, included with Redux Toolkit), are defined in `store/selectors/`. Selectors encapsulate the logic for deriving data from the state.
  - **Naming**: Selectors should generally follow a `get<StateSlice><Data>` pattern (e.g., `getNegotiatingDataSelector`).

## Component Interaction

- **Accessing State**: Use the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux` combined with predefined selectors from `store/selectors/` to access state data.
  - *Example*: See `components/modules/Negotiating/index.js` usage of `useSelector(getNegotiatingDataSelector)`.
- **Dispatching Actions**: Use the `useDispatch` hook from `react-redux` to dispatch actions imported from the relevant slices.

## Best Practices

- Keep state normalized, especially within `entities`.
- Use selectors to decouple components from the exact state structure.
- Leverage Redux Toolkit's features (like `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`) to simplify reducer logic and handle async operations.

# Testing Conventions

This rule outlines the conventions for writing unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library, as specified in the [Technical Stack Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/stack.mdc).

## Test File Location

- Test files should be co-located with the source files they are testing.
- Place test files in a `__tests__` subdirectory within the component or module directory.
  - _Example_: A test for `components/units/Button/index.js` should be located at `components/units/Button/__tests__/index.test.js`.

## Naming Conventions

- Test files should use the `.test.js` (or `.test.ts` if using TypeScript) suffix.
- _Example_: `myComponent.test.js`

## Test Structure

- Use `describe`, `it` (or `test`), and `expect` blocks provided by Jest.
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks.
- Use clear and descriptive names for `describe` and `it` blocks.

## Mocking

- Use Jest's built-in mocking capabilities (`jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`) to mock dependencies like API calls, modules, or functions.
- Mock API responses to ensure tests are predictable and don't rely on external services.
- Keep mocks focused and relevant to the specific test case.

## Querying Elements

- Prefer accessible queries (e.g., `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText`) over implementation details (e.g., `getByTestId`, CSS selectors) whenever possible.

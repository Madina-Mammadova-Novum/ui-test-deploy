# Library (`lib/`)

This rule defines the purpose and conventions for the `lib/` directory.

## Purpose

- The `lib/` directory typically houses core application logic, configurations, constants, or integrations that are not specific UI components or API handlers.
- It can serve as a place for shared modules, third-party library configurations, or foundational code used throughout the application.

## Common Subdirectories/Files

- **`lib/constants/`**: For defining application-wide constants (e.g., `NEGOTIATING_TABS` seen in `components/modules/Negotiating/index.js`). Constants should generally use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **`lib/config/`**: For application configuration files or setup.
- **`lib/hooks/`**: If custom React hooks are used, they might reside here, following the `useSomething` naming convention.
- **`lib/clients/`**: For configuring third-party API clients or SDKs.

## Distinction from `utils/`

- While `utils/` contains small, generic helper functions, `lib/` often contains more substantial or application-specific modules, configurations, and core functionalities.

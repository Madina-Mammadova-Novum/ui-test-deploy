# Technical Stack Overview

This rule provides an overview of the technical stack and associated guidelines for the ShipLink project, based on [docs/technical/stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/stack.md).

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22.x (>=22.0.0)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.3 (using `pages/api`, SSR, App Router partially)
- **React**: 19.1.1
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (with Redux Persist, custom slices, Thunk)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with custom theme, responsive design, utility-first, custom breakpoint `3md: 1024px`)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form (with Yup for schema validation, custom maritime rules)

## Development Tools

- **Code Quality**: ESLint & Prettier (custom rules, automated formatting via husky git hooks)
- **Type Checking**: PropTypes required for all components (except `children`)
- **Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library (unit, integration, business logic testing, API mocking)

## Key Libraries

- **Data Handling**: `date-fns` (timezones, laycan), `lodash`, `axios` (custom headers), `yup`
- **UI Components**: `react-select` (async search, debounce 400ms, caching), `react-datepicker`
- **Maps**: `react-leaflet` (vessel tracking, port visualization, custom markers)
  - _See TODOs in [docs/technical/stack.md](mdc:docs/technical/stack.md) for planned map features._

## Development Environment

- **Build**: Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, SWC
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits standard.
  - **Scopes**: `owner`, `charterer`, `vessel`, `cargo`, `ui`, `api`, `fix`, `negotiation`

## Performance

- **Client**: Image optimization, code splitting, route prefetching, progressive loading, debouncing, memoization.
- **Server**: API route optimization, caching, DB query optimization, rate limiting.

## Security

- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens, role-based access control (RBAC), session management.
- **Data Protection**: HTTPS, API request validation, data encryption, maritime compliance checks.

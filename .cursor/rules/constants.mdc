# Constants

This rule defines the conventions for defining and using constants within the ShipLink application.

## Location

- Application-wide constants should primarily reside in the `lib/constants/` directory.
- Group related constants into logical files within this directory (e.g., `apiEndpoints.js`, `maritimeUnits.js`, `uiMessages.js`).
- Constants specific to a single component or module may be defined within that module if they are not reused elsewhere, but prefer the central location for broader constants.

## Naming Convention

- Constants must use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- *Example*: `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `NEGOTIATING_TABS`.

## Purpose

- Use constants to represent fixed values like configuration settings, API endpoints, UI text strings, magic numbers, or enumerated types.
- Centralizing constants improves maintainability and reduces errors caused by typos or inconsistent values.

## Example Usage (from `lib.mdc`)

- The `NEGOTIATING_TABS` constant, likely defined in `lib/constants/`, is used in `components/modules/Negotiating/index.js`.

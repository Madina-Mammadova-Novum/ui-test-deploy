# Code Style Conventions

This rule outlines key code style conventions enforced by ESLint ([.eslintrc](mdc:.eslintrc)) and Prettier, complementing the [Technical Stack Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/stack.mdc).

## Import Order

Imports must follow a specific order enforced by the `import/order` ESLint rule. Adhering to this order improves readability and consistency. The general order is:

1.  **Built-in Modules** (e.g., `react`, `path`, `fs`)
2.  **External Packages** (e.g., `lodash`, `axios`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`)
    *   Includes aliased paths like `@/*`.
3.  **Internal Modules** (Using path groups defined in `.eslintrc`)
    *   `hooks/**`
    *   `hocs/**`
    *   `helpers/**`
    *   `resources/**`
    *   `services/**`
    *   `store/**`
4.  **Parent/Sibling/Index Imports**
    *   `components/**` falls into this group.
    *   Relative paths like `../`, `./`
5.  **Object Imports** (`import { type } from ...`)
6.  **Type Imports** (`import type ...`)
7.  **Unknown** (Less common)

**Note:** Newlines are required between different groups.

While Prettier and ESLint format on save (via Husky hooks), understanding this order helps when manually adding imports.

## PropTypes

- As specified in the [Component Architecture Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/components.mdc) and enforced by `.eslintrc` (`react/prop-types`), PropTypes are **required** for all component props **except** for `children`.

## Other Conventions

- **Formatting**: Code formatting (spacing, line breaks, semicolons, etc.) is handled automatically by Prettier on save (via Husky hooks). Key configurations from [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc) include:
    - `printWidth: 120`
    - `singleQuote: true`
    - `trailingComma: "es5"`
    - `tabWidth: 2`
    - `semi: true`
    - Tailwind CSS class sorting via `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`.
- **Linting**: Refer to the full [.eslintrc](mdc:.eslintrc) for specific linting rules (e.g., `no-console`, max classes, naming conventions enforced by Airbnb config).

# Maritime Standards & Calculations

This rule summarizes key maritime standards, units, calculations, and states used in the ShipLink platform, based on [docs/maritime/standards.md](mdc:docs/maritime/standards.md).

## Units

- **Weight**: DWT (Deadweight Tonnage), MT (Metric Tons)
- **Volume**: m³ (Cubic Meters)
- **Density**: mt/m³ (Metric Tons per Cubic Meter)

## Standard Ranges

- **Laytime**: 12-120 hours
- **Tolerance** (e.g., for cargo quantity): ±5-10%
- **Cargo Density**: 0.6-2.0 mt/m³

## Core Calculations

Ensure correct implementation for:
- Laytime
- Demurrage
- Freight
- Bunker (Fuel)
- Cargo Capacity

## Deal / Operation States

Follow this state progression:
1.  Negotiating
2.  On Subs (Subject to Conditions)
3.  Failed
4.  Completed
5.  Lifted (Subjects Lifted / Confirmed)
6.  Cancelled

## API Response Requirements

- Responses involving maritime data must adhere to defined business rules.
- Calculations and data must follow established maritime standards.
- Include necessary unit conversions where applicable.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.920
Over the last 200 years,

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.640
while commerce and shipping
have been at the forefront of

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.240
 industrial and technological efficiency,

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.440
one part of shipping has remained
inefficiently outdated -

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.280
the vessel brokerage.

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.480
Today, like two centuries ago,

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.680
a merchant looking to ship
cargo relies on a human broker

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
with a limited network of vessel owners
to find a suitable vessel.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.440
The system would work
well if a broker could cover all,

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.880
or even most, of vessels suitable
for a requested route.

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.120
But with thirty thousand merchant vessels
roaming the globe,

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
that is an impossible task.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.560
Ship.Link addresses this problem

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
by eliminating the human bottleneck
in vessel brokerage.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Vessel owners
no longer need to communicate position

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.080
lists with multiple brokers,
hoping to reach potential charterers.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.920
Instead, they list their vessel positions

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.920
in one place, on Ship.Link, and gain global access to charterers.

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.680
Charterers,
in turn, no longer need to contact

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.800
or rely on numerous brokers
to find a suitable vessel.

21
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.760
Instead,
they use Ship.Link's advanced search engine

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
to identify vessels suitable
for their requirements.

23
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.360
Charterers then send an opening offer
to owners of matching vessels,

24
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.560
and negotiate terms directly
with the vessel owners on the platform.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.640
If an agreement is reached
and the vessel subjects are lifted,

26
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
the governing charter party is generated

27
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.960
and signed digitally on Ship.Link.
